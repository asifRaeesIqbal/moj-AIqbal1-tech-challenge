# MOJ Test Application

Is a basic spring boot application. It follows a layered architecture. built using the following:

* Spring-boot
* Java 8
* Maven

## Resources used:

https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot

https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/jf14-date-time.html

https://springfox.github.io/springfox/

https://springfox.github.io/springfox/docs/current/

## Assumption:

Bookings can be made during closing times, as long as booking time is within opening hours.

Full responses for the web api not provided as was not a requirement.

Complete set of unit tests are not required. 

## Approach:

I decided I wanted something very quick and easy to set up so decided to create a scaffold spring boot, which was generated by STS IDE.

The problem takes in an input and requires some validation performed on it. Instantly i thought of the chain of responsibility pattern, where by
I want the input to pass through various tests. If any of the tests fail, then its an overall failure. However in spring i wanted i decided to use 
the common spring pattern of creating a list of type, and iterating over them passing in the parameter. 

I decided to investigate and use Spring fox to provide swagger documentation which nicely integrates using annotations, and provides a nice set of 
documentation.


## Running the application

The application can be started using jar file (located in target folder in source). IF NOT source code will need to be compiled and jar built using Maven command (mvn install). Once the JAR file is found or built, it can be run using the following command.

java -jar moj-challenge-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

The application should be available on localhost port 8080

the swagger for the application is also available on :

http://localhost:8080/moj/swagger-ui.html
